// Examples:

// Submitting a form (e.g., login, signup, comment)

// Uploading a file

// Adding a new review or booking on Airbnb

// <form action="/listings/<%= listing.id %>/reviews" method="POST">
// Explanation:
// action: This sets the URL where the form data will be sent when submitted.

// <%= listing.id %>: This is EJS syntax. It dynamically inserts the id of the current listing.

// method="POST": This means the form will send data via a POST request.


// The full form of URL is Uniform Resource Locator.

// Itâ€™s the address used to access resources on the internet, like webpages, images, or APIs.


// class important for form making are -->
